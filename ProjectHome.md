# Features #
The system developed by this project manages genomics data generated from Next Generation sequencers. It also manages information generated during the following research studies using these data. It helps researchers to prepare to deposit data into Short Read Archive at National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA or at European Bioinformatics Institute, UK with as less as possible human intervention. The collection description, along with relevant, associated party, activity records are made available for harvesting to Research Data Australia.

**This is an ANDS funded data capture project - DC08**
